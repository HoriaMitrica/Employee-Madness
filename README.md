# Employee Madness

## About the project

This is the MERN learning project that came with styling from Codecool.

I added frontend features such as filtering, sorting, pagination and one aditional column "years of experience" that is stored in the database.

The equipment tab and table are created from scratch.

### Target

To make working with employees tables easier.
